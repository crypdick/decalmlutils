**rd_utils** is a lightweight python library that contains functions and code snippets that
I use in my everyday research with Machine Learning.

I created this repo because I was tired of always looking up same code from older projects and I wanted to gain some experience in building a Python library.
By making this available to everyone it gives me easy access to code I use frequently and it can help others in their machine learning work.
If you find any bugs or something doesn't make sense please feel free to open an issue.

# Snippets

This is a very large variety of Python snippets without a certain theme. I put them in the most frequently used ones while keeping a logical order.
I like to have them as simple and as efficient as possible.
